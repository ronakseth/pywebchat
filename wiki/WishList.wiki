#summary Features to be added to pywebchat

This page records features that it would be nice to see added to PyWebChat.
If you think you can help with a feature/task, email t33n4n@gmail.com

= Features =

*Allow users to specify the port the server runs on with a command line argument.
e.g. $python ChatServer.py 80

*Design a logo and add it to the login.html and chat.html markup

*Add additional stylesheets (CSS) and allow the user to choose which one to use with a command line argument when the server is started

*Add a search(searchstring) method to the ChatServer class that searches existing messages for a string, and returns the messages found in a ServerResponse object. (This will be used later in a search feature to be added)

*Add a getMessageBy(username) method to the ChatServer class that returns all the messages by user 'username'. (This will be used later in a feature where clicking a username displays all the message by that user)

*add CSS for the 'error' and 'notification' divs so that they display in the right place.
