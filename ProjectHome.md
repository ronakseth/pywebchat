PyWebChat is a slick but simple web based chat server written in python, designed to be simple to setup and usable in any modern browser.  The program is intended to be used in a LAN environment.
The aim of the project is to give those wishing to make a start in open source software somewhere to start. Anyone with even modest knowledge of Python or JavaScript can make a valuable contribution to the project, and help out in the ongoing development and expansion of a simple application.
